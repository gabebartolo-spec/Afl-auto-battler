# Agent status board

Read this at the start of every task. Send changes to your own line to the
low agent, who keeps this file from 2026-10-06 (other agents can't push to its branch).
The director decides; the high agent directs the agents.
_Updated 2026-10-06 against main `d586960` (since the last board: #266, #267, #268, #275, #278, #279, #280 merged; #272 and #274 merged before it)._

## Lanes
| agent (session) | owns |
|---|---|
| high ("high effort tasks - Boss") | lead: direction, task assignment, synergy/position work |
| medium ("medium effort tasks") | medium tasks, measured audits, this board, team information flow |
| low ("low effort tasks") | CI and merges, the merge queue, low-effort tasks, effort tags |
| art ("art agent") | vignette figures, guernseys and shorts, player appearance, asset pipeline; now: ARD-M8-007 broadcast family migration (in progress) |

## File claims (don't edit another agent's claim; message them)
| agent | files | until |
|---|---|---|
| high | lead: assigns and directs; current branches as listed under Open PRs | ongoing |
| medium | STYLE-01/02/04/05/06 engineering in `UiKit.gd` and the touched screens, landing order in the style inventory | after the director approves the art agent's dark-slice sheet |
| medium (later) | MatchSim no-presentation perf mode | check with high first |
| low | `TrainingScene._player_row` (3 lines, #277); new `tools/visual/capture_training_rows.gd`. `.github/workflows`, `tools/ci_shards.txt` and `UiKit.scroll` are merged: no claim | #277 merges, after the director approves its capture |
| art | `BroadcastVignette.gd` (draw functions only; `pick_kind`, `DURATIONS` untouched); `VignetteFigures.gd`, `assets/vignette/figures_*.png` (sheet being regenerated); `StoppageVignette._draw_figure`; `tools/visual/capture_appearance.gd`, `capture_guernseys.gd`, new `capture_broadcast.gd`; standing: `figure.gdshader`, `clubs.csv` guernsey column, `GameDB.club_guernsey`, `player_appearance.csv`, `Appearance.gd`. Next, in order: `AwardWinnerVignette.gd`, `MediaConferenceVignette.gd` | M8-007 migration |

## Merge queue (low agent runs it: green CI on the exact head + clean against main)
- Held for the director's visual approval (§9.5): #277 training-row alignment (low; STYLE-01 KNOWN BUG) and #276 press-conference figures (art). Both are green and clean; the low agent merges them once the director has approved the capture.

## Open PRs and dependencies
| PR | owner | notes |
|---|---|---|
| #277 | low | `TrainingScene._player_row`: `info.alignment = CENTER`; dark 320/390 captures |
| #276 | art | ARD-M8-007 press conference on the pre-rendered figures |
| #232, #206 | director | research docs; #206 superseded by #208 |

## Pending director decisions
- Difficulty: autopilot slides to rank 18 by year 5; routine contract work holds about 6th; flags need trading (0 of 40 for contracts + FA, 3 for full management). Evidence: medium's managed-vs-autopilot doc. Is that the intended curve?
- Goalkicking attribute saturates at 99 (#237): give scoring metrics headroom? Balance-gated.
- Running machine stays under the +8% bar at ×0.50 (high kept ×0.50).
- STYLE-01–08: approve the art agent's dark-slice sheet; medium then engineers it.
- #206 close; one-command branch cleanup (low agent's list).

## Working rules
- One Godot process per agent at a time. Isolate user data: `APPDATA=<your scratch dir>`.
- Revert `.import` churn before committing. Never commit another agent's untracked files.
- Merge notes go in the PR body or a `[MERGE NOTE]` comment: hot files, floors raised, ordering, ROADMAP lines.
- Owners sync their own branches. A floor conflict resolves to the sum of the increments.
- Don't push to a PR branch while its CI runs unless the merge needs it: a push cancels CI and restarts it.
- A new test suite needs a line in `tools/ci_shards.txt`, or CI's plan job fails.
- Before you next sync main, move aside any UNTRACKED copies of these 8 generated files, because main now tracks them and git will refuse the sync: `tools/audit/coleman_impl.gd.uid`, `gk_cap_impl.gd.uid`, `injury_seed_impl.gd.uid`, `round_perf_impl.gd.uid`, and `assets/audio/music/{draft_room_rain,hub_after_hours,long_season,matchday_morning}.wav.import`. Move them out of the repo, merge main, and keep the committed ones. Revert Godot `.import` churn with `git ls-files -m | grep '\.import$' | xargs git restore --`.
- #274 tracks four more generated files; move aside untracked copies of `tools/audit/{kf_kd,synergy_career,synergy,synergy_on}_impl.gd.uid` the same way.
- `audit.yml` dispatches run independently since #261, so there are no more lost runs. A branch made before #261 keeps the old workflow until it merges main.
